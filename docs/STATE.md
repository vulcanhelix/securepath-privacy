# Orchestrator state — session handover

Updated after every merge. Next session reads BUILD_PLAN_R1.md → BACKLOG.md → this file.

## Last update

2026-11-05 — plan v2 written after adversarial spec review. Awaiting William's
confirmation that v0.2 sits underneath the existing build (email sent). Do NOT start
W0 before that lands — W0-00 (authz remodel) and W0-04 (tracks→programmes) both
depend on the answer.

## In flight

(none)

## Next unblocked

- Commit plan v2 + spec + backlog + status.sh.
- On William's confirmation: W0-00 authz remodel — the long pole, start first.

## Open questions for William

- v0.2 supersedes pipeline or sits underneath? (email sent 2026-11-05)
- NFR-11 deviation: single-region (SA) at launch + region plumbing, or UK residency
  required at launch? Needs written call.
- NFR-02 interim: stream-through-server today vs signed links in W4-09.
- External providers/assessors: login users (MFA + seats) or token links?
- "All staff report a breach" — authenticated or anonymous intake form?
- Deferred status (§15-#13): we build it into the status enum regardless — confirm.
- Licence/pricing model (§15-#3) — affects `licences` schema; needed before W0-01 final.
- First-client tracker file + POPIA template content — gates W3-02/AT-10 (BLOCKED-EXT).
- §15 decisions (15 items, his).

## Verified facts (from v2 review pass)

- `memberships` PK is `user_id` — one role per user, no platform level. Spec's role
  model needs the W0-00 remodel; it is NOT a view over memberships.
- pg_cron 1.6 present in staging postgres image (supabase/postgres:15.8.1.049) —
  enable via shared_preload_libraries, or fallback systemd-timer→RPC (W1-09 decides).
- No browser/Playwright test harness in repo — UI acceptances are API/manual until W4-00.
- `notifications` is practice-broadcast (no per-user rows) — rebuild, don't extend.
- `monthly_reports` lacks snapshot/signatures/workflow — `programme_reports` replaces it.
